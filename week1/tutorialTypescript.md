# Introduction to TypeScript
In this tutorial we will learn:
- What is TypeScript?
- What is TypeScript's relation to JavaScript?
- How to use TypeScript in our JavaScript projects
- TypeScript Classes
- TypeScript Decorators

> For this tutorial, we presume you've done the [this tutorial](tutorialTranspiling.md) and [this tutorial](tutorialBundling.md) about Node, NPM, Babel and Webpack.
> Also, it's useful to first do [this tutorial on ES6 Classes](tutorialES6Classes.md) and [this tutorial](tutorialBundling.md) about Node, NPM, Babel and Webpack.

### Recap on Bundling and Transpiling
So far we've seen that:
- The only version of JavaScript that is 100% supported by all modern browsers is ES5
- People writing JavaScript today feel the ES5 is missing some key features to make the development experience robust and fun.
- New features are implemented regularly. ES6 brings many new features to the workplace, and we can expect ES7, ES8 to come out at some point as well
- To use all new features today we need to: a) transpile ES6 to ES5 (we choose Babel); b) combine all of our modules and libraries we installed using a bundler (we choose Webpack)

### One step further
So now we're going to make a step even further: introducing TypeScript. Many programmers coming from different backgrounds such as C++, Python or Ruby are missing a lot of features in their development experience when they write JavaScript. Even ES6 is missing many features. So, Microsoft made what's called a superset of JavaScript: TypeScript
