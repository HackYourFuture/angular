# Angular - Reading material for week 1

> This is the first time we're teaching this new module. Please help us improve it by providing feedback on Slack.

Our first Angular product is going to be, of course, a working web-applicationt that fully implements the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern.

That means we're going to have, in our application:
 - A Model (a piece of data)
 - A View (a HTML template that shows the data to the user and let's the user give input)
 - A Controller (a piece of code that knows what to do with user input and perform some logic)

Some extra info:
- You can work together (in pairs or even groups) if you want
