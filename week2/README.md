# HackYourFuture Angular - Week 2

> This is the first time we're teaching this new module. Please help us improve it by providing feedback on Slack.

## Learning goals week 2
Let's first wrap up what we've seen so far:
- *Angular CLI* A tool that sets up our development environment. It provides all sorts of elements like transpiling, bundling, unit + e2e testing and generate new components. For the rest of this module, we're not going to focus too much on the CLI. Even experienced Angular developers will not fully understand everything that Angular does, because it's so big. What we will focus on is understanding how to make it work for us, and when we run into issues, we'll learn by fixing them.
- *MVC* Model View Controller: A commonly used software development pattern that is a way to implement Separation of Concerns
- *Component and Template*: Components control what happens to a view. A view is a patch of HTML. 

So, now we know a bit about how to View and Control. This week, we'll learn how to properly implement a Model.

Remember: a model is a piece of data representing something coherent. For example: we can say "users model" or "todo-items model"   

In Angular, models are owned and governed by Services
