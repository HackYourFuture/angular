# Angular - Homework for week 2

> This is the first time we're teaching this new module. Please help us improve it by providing feedback on Slack.

We're going to build the same thing as we did last week: a web application that can list a specific resource. This time, we all choose the same resource: users. We are going to store the data in an external service: an API.
