# HackYourFuture - Angular
Angular, aah, who doesn't love Angular...? What do you mean checkout react? Oh React! Go back to your Wall!

Or so it goes.

Hi! Welcome to the Angular module. Angular is a super-modern framework that will help us make fun-to-develop, robust, highly-performant web applications. Note: Angular is NOT Angular.JS

## Planning for Current Class
Kind notice: each week, students are expected to finish all reading material *before class* so we can discuss the topics like a bunch of sophisticated ladies/gentlemen. Assignments/Homework is to be handed in by Thursday 9AM, so it can be reviewed Thursday/Friday.

| Week | Topic | Read | Homework |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | -------- |
| 1. | ES6, TypeScript, Bundling, Transpiling, MVC, Components, Template syntax | [Week 1 Reading](week1/README.md) | [Week 1 Homework](week1/MAKEME.md) |
| 2. | Modules, Services, HTTP | [Week 2 Reading](week2/README.md) | [Week 2 Homework](week2/MAKEME.md) |
| 3. | Routing, Firebase | [Week 3 Reading](week3/README.md) | [Week 3 Homework](week3/MAKEME.md) |

TBA = To Be Announced

## What will we learn?
- How to use a Transpiler to convert ES6 into browser-safe JavaScript
- How to use a Bundler to combine multiple modules into one, browser-safe file
- How to use a TypeScript transpiler to convert TypeScript into browser-safe JavaScript
- What is a Model?
- What is a View?
- How to setup an Angular application using the Angular CLI
- How to create Components, component controllers and component templates using Angular.
- How to create Services using Angular.

There is much more to learn about Angular than just these elements. This, we hope, will give us the basis to understand the outline of other people's Angular code when we start working at another company, or enable us to choose Angular when starting to work on our own projects.

## Why learn Angular?
There are millions of web applications and native (iOS/Android) out there. Now, say, today we want to create our own application, and we want it to be awesome and modern and at least as good as all those others. If you know how to write JavaScript, you have what it takes to write ANY web application that's out there. Literally. ANY. Remember, everyone running a web application must follow the same rules, and use the exact same building blocks: HTML/CSS/JavaScript. So why should we learn Angular?

First, why use any library or framework at all? Answer: >99% of all the things you want to do have been done before (no worries, that 1% will still be enough to be unique). >99% of all the problems you run into have been solved by others before you. Fortunately, the world of software has been built with sharing and [freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) in its heart. So we can [Stand on the Shoulders of Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants).

Second, why use Angular? Angular is a framework that meets a

There are many alternatives. We chose Angular because it is fun (at least some of us think so) and know many companies use Angular. It has a [huge community](https://github.com/angular/angular) (20k+ stars) and is actively developed by Google and will be developed for the coming years. There are definitely alternatives, most notably [Facebook's React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). Both are awesome. Neither is a bad choice. Learn one well and get a cool job. Learn both well and get rich... can I use emoji's in GitHub? :grin: :euro: :euro: heck yes I can.
